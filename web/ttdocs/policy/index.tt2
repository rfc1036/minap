<p>
Each member must have a valid non private ASN (Autonomous System Number), use
BGP version 4 for peerings and provide a 24x7 operational contact.</p>
<p>Only free of charge traffic is allowed over MINAP: members shall not sell
peering or transit over the MINAP infrastructure.</p>

<p>Members shall not give transit to the address space of the peering LAN.
The peering ports must use only the IP addresses and netmasks
(prefix lengths) assigned to them by MINAP.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://manager.minap.it/public-content/rs">MINAP route servers</a> implement a strict filtering policy using
prefix-lists generated from IRR data and RPKI validation. Only prefixes
with a corresponding route or route6 object or a valid ROA are accepted.</p>

<p>Each member is physically connected to the MINAP switch via a dedicated
cable. Cable sharing is not allowed and only one MAC address is authorised per
member port.</p>

<p>Features and link-local protocols like, but not limited to: Proxy ARP, ICMP
redirects, the Spanning Tree Protocol, IGMP, CDP, VTP, LLDP, OSFP, PIM and
ICMPv6 ND-RA are not allowed and must be disabled.</p>
<p>Frames sent to the MINAP port must have one of the following ethertypes:
0x0800 (IPv4), 0x0806 (ARP) or 0x86dd (IPv6). Frames shall not be addressed to
a multicast or broadcast MAC destination address except when needed by the ARP
and ICMPv6-ND protocols.</p>
<p>MINAP cannot be responsible for direct or indirect consequential loss, loss
of profits, business, revenue, goodwill, or anticipated savings resulting from
a MINAP service outage.</p>
<p><strong>MINAP can suspend or discontinue the connection, in whole or in
part, with no advance warnings:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If the member is not respecting any of the rules above or is causing
technical problems to the MINAP infrastructure or to other members.</li>
<li>In case of force majeur.</li>
<li>If MINAP receives an autoritative request or desires to comply with a statutory obligation.</li>
<li>If maintenance is required.</li>
</ul>
