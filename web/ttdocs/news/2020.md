In July and August we have wasted^Wspent quite some time fighting IOS
bugs, the last being [CSCvt15358] which affected the new 100GE switches
and which we suspect was at least a contributing cause of the
blackholing event reported by MINAP NOC on June 12.

MINAP NOC wants to acknowledge here the great help that we received
from Akamai in August while debugging CSCvt15358.

Other bugs appear to have been solved by IOS upgrades, like:

* issues with VPLS MAC learning
* mangled frames
* OSPF instability

We have also spent quite some time addding new inter-switch circuits
in the campus.

Since our last update in February:

* All switches have been upgraded to IOS-XE 16.12.04.
* Some members upgraded to 100GE ports! (And some others are still
  working on it.)
* The Metrolink (IRIDEOS Avalon) and CDLAN POPs are now connected
  by a 100GE circuit.
* The Seeweb POP is now connected with a total 4x40GE to both switches
  in each of the Metrolink (IRIDEOS Avalon) and CDLAN POPs.
* The link between the 10G and 100G switches in the Metrolink (IRIDEOS
  Avalon) POP has been upgraded to 2x40GE.
* The [AS43369:AS-RS-v4](https://apps.db.ripe.net/db-web-ui/query?searchtext=AS43369:AS-RS-v4)
  and [AS43369:AS-RS-v6](https://apps.db.ripe.net/db-web-ui/query?searchtext=AS43369:AS-RS-v6)
  as-sets are now available
  in the RIPE IRR for the benefit of members who want to prefix-filter
  the route servers sessions.
* IXP Manager has been kept up to date as usual.

As usual, the MINAP topology is shown in detail in the [weathermap](/network/).

TODO:

* Migrate the route servers to bird 2.
* Implement RPKI validation on the route servers.

Stalled:

* We have a new design for www.minap.it, which still needs to be cleaned
  up and integrated.
* L2 blackholing (RS support is still missing, no clear members demand).


### January 16 (update #8) ###

**NEW!** Now MINAP supports 40GE and 100GE members connections.

Two new Cisco C9500-32QC switches for the IRIDEOS/Avalon and CDLAN POPs
have been provided by [Mynet](https://www.mynet.it/) and
[CDLAN](https://www.caldera21.com/).

New members:

* Brennercom (pending connection)
* Fastcon
* Telemar
* Neten (pending connection)
* WorldStream (pending connection)

Since our last update in November:

* We installed a new switch with 100GE ports in the IRIDEOS/Avalon POP:
  now we can accept members connections at 40GE and 100GE.
* Wa are working on adding more mesh connections between our POPs.

In progress:

* Soon we will install the other 100GE switch in the CDLAN POP.
* L2 blackholing (RS support is still missing, no clear members demand).

TODO:

* Migrate the route servers to bird 2.
* Implement RPKI validation on the route servers.

Stalled:

* We have a new design for www.minap.it, which still needs to be cleaned
  up and integrated.
