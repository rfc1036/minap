  [DD-IX](https://dd-ix.net/)'s
  [sflow_exporter](https://github.com/dd-ix/sflow_exporter)
  and custom graphs created with [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/).
  Thanks to Messagenet for some help with the Javascript.
  It is available to members in the IXP manager *Documentation* menu.

  the route servers.
