Since our last update in July 2022:

* A new switch with 100GE ports has been installed in the Seeweb data 
  center.
* Before that, a second 48x10GE switch was installed in the Seeweb data
  center to have more capacity available, and then removed again.
* rs2 has been upgraded to a Raspberry Pi 4.
* rs2 has been upgraded to Debian 12 and BIRD 2.x, so now it supports
  RPKI validation using rpki-client.
* rs2 is now managed by an [Ansible playbook](https://github.com/rfc1036/minap/blob/master/ansible/servers/server2.yaml).
* Mynet provided SVG versions of the MINAP logo.

TODO:

* Move rs1 to the new server provided by myloc.
* Implement RTT-based traffic engineering communities.
